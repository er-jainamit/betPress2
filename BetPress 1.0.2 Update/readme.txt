Hi and thank you for reading this :)


The betpress.zip file is actually the plugin.

If you install BetPres for first time:
Select that file if you are installing via the admin dashboard.
Or you can extract the file and manually upload it via FTP.

If you want to update the plugin:
First of all: never uninstall your current version of BetPress via the admin dashboard because this will lose all your current data!
Instead, you should just replace your current files manually via FTP. Deactivate BetPress from the admin dashboard. Extract the betpress.zip, open the just created betpress folder, copy all of the files and place them in your-root-wordpress/wp-content/plugins/betpress. Activate BetPress from the admin dashboard.


The Documentation folder contains all the information about the plugin.
You can open index.html with any browser and no internet connection is required. There is also an online version which you can find here: http://web-able.com/betpress/docs/


Thank you once again and feel free to contact us anytime at office@web-able.com
